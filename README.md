# AnnualInterestCalculator

This is a simple piece of code made with Java 8 in the Eclipse IDE.

## Functionality

- Calculates the annual interest accrued based on given interest rate.
- Users can specify how much money is initially in the account.
- Users can specify whether they deposit a fixed amount of cash monthly, or if it varies each month.
- Users can specify the number of years the program will calculate their interest for.

- Program will detail:-
 - The accrued interest per month and year.
 - The total amount of money per month and year.
 - The paid interest per month.
 
 ### Additional information
 
 The program assumes that interest is paid out each month.
 
 Future work may be undertaken to expand on this project.
